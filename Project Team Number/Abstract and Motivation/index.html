<h2>Abstract and Motivation</h2>

<p>
During the past few years, COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges to countries around the world, 
particularly in ensuring that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. Enforcing lockdowns has been commonly used to slow the spread of the virus. 
However, while effective, these lockdowns have come with high economic costs.  
Additionally, unemployment, mental health problems and reduced life expectations have become significant social issues.
</p>

<p>
To address these challenges, we aim to establish an extended epidemiological SEIR model that can analyse tailored measures for epidemic prevention and control. 
The SEIR model is a commonly used epidemiological model that divides a population into four compartments: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered. 
The proposed model aims to integrate different groups into the SEIR model, each with unique characteristics and responses to public health interventions.
</p>

<p>

By incorporating group-specific social distancing and tracing measures, such as those based on sectors, regions, or age groups, the proposed model is able to analyse how these measures interact in situations with numerous groups. 
The model will also consider group-specific behavioural responses, which may help to inform policymakers and public health officials about the effectiveness of different interventions and how they can be tailored to specific groups. 
Overall, the extended epidemiological SEIR model can be a valuable tool in addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and improving epidemic prevention and control.
